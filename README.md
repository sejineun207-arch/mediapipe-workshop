# face-hand-vibe

Zero-install starter for live **face + hand tracking in the browser** using p5.js and MediaPipe Tasks Vision. The point: spend your time on the *mapping* — what your project does with the signals — not on plumbing.

## Quickstart (60 seconds)

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. **Serve it locally** (browsers block camera on `file://`):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # or:  npx serve
   ```
3. Open <http://localhost:8000> in Chrome or Edge. Allow camera access.
4. You should see your webcam with a yellow circle on your nose and pink circles on your index fingertips. Open your mouth — the nose circle grows.
5. Open `sketch.js`. Change one number. Save. Refresh.

Each example folder is self-contained — open its `index.html` directly.

## The API in one sentence

```js
const tracker = new Tracker({ face: true, hands: true });
tracker.start();
tracker.onUpdate(({ face, hands }) => {
  if (face) {
    const mouth = face.signals.mouthOpen; // 0..1
    // ...do something
  }
});
```

That's it. See the full workshop doc for the named landmarks, the full list of derived signals, recipes, and troubleshooting.

## Browser support

Works in recent Chrome and Edge. Safari is mostly fine but slower. Mobile varies.
